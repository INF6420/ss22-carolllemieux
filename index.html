                <h2>Transformation in Educational Technology is More Rare then One Might Think</h2> 
                <p> <a href = "https://itsnotthetech.wordpress.com/"> It's not the Tech, blog post by Carol LeMiuex</a><br>
                    I have attended several ISTE conferences and a few Learning 2.0 unconferences over the years and each time I attend these technology and 
                    learning-focused conferences I am intent on finding one thing; a true 
                    example of redefined teaching and learning. Each time I find exciting 
                    new ways to integrate technology into student learning opportunities, 
                    yet in all these conferences I have only once attended a session where 
                    truly I felt that the addition of the technology was significantly affecting students learning.</p>

                    <p>I wish I could remember the name of the teacher who presented this session. She taught 
                    sixth-grade math and used a combination of cloud resources to differentiate the instruction 
                    her students received. She did this on a daily basis with a great deal of attention to each 
                    student’s particular needs. The tasks these students were doing using the technology were simple 
                    substitution or possibly augmented activities, replacing the paper and pencil with 
                    “Explain Everything” and the answer sheet with a Google Form. But what she did with 
                    the data she received from these sources redefined the students’ ability to get exactly 
                    the teaching they needed. If she had just focused on the task; i.e. using Explain Everything 
                    to record the problem-solving process of her students, one might think that this redefined the task. 
                    The teacher can now both see the process and hear the thinking of the students. 
                    However, I have seen many teachers use this app for just this purpose, but then not follow up on 
                    the rich data they were collecting about students thinking or in many cases thinking the students 
                    doing the task was sufficient and never listening to the videos at all. SAMR focuses on redefining tasks, 
                    but I want to focus on the learning that will result from the tasks.</p>
