            Book trailers are a fun way for students to show their comprehension of a book and advocate for others to
            read the book. This trailer was done as a part of a children's literatuer course during the MLIS course of
            study.

            <P>Schools have had to make some difficult financial decisions in the last few years.
                Modern times require modern tools, however, a pencil costs pennies, while compters
                cost hundreds of dollars. Where does a school district of a fixed very low per pupil budget find the
                funds to purchase a device for every student. It seems many schools elliminated librarians.
                Since this trend has started in the United States literacy scores have been dropping. </P>
